**SQL (Structured Query language)**
MongoDB is a NoSQL Data Base

DBMS => Data Base Management System

Data base allows you to do CRUD operations => Create, Read Update & Delete

SQL is a query language

Data base is the collection of Data, & the system that alows you to put data, fetch Data is called DBMS

SQL is a language through which you do CRUD

Data Base has 2 types:

1. Relational Database = which has tables and we can manage the Data tye in coloumns, & collection of rows & coloumns is called a table example: Excel sheet, like in a Excel sheet we can refer to as a table, and collection of tables is called a Database (table is a collection of rows & coloumns & collection of tables if called a relational database)
     Each coloumn should have a type & no 2 rows should be identical, & value should be atomic in a row + coloumn => Atomic (lets say if any user has multiple phone number then it should be stored in different-2 coloumns that would be good practice)
2. NoSQL Database
